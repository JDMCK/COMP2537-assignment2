# Members Only
Members only is a project I completed during my second semester that implemented the concepts of password encryption, cookies, authenticaion, input sanitation, server architecture, and dynamically generated page content.
## Content
This website includes a sign in page, a publicly available home page, and an authenticated-users-only page, all built from scratch. The server that deals with the serving the pages, sanitizing user input, and authenticating is built with Node.js and express.
