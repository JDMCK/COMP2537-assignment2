# Members Only
Members Only is a project I completed during my second semester that implemented the concepts of password encryption, cookies, authenticaion, input sanitation, server architecture, user permissions, and dynamically generated page content. I did this using ejs, css, and Node.js.

## Content
This website includes a sign in page, a publicly available home page, and an authenticated-users-only page, all built from scratch. The server that deals with the serving the pages, sanitizing user input, and authenticating is built with Node.js and express.
